## 0.89.0
**BUMPED:** bumped to tududi v0.89.0 (stable release)

**IMPROVED:** Session secret auto-generation
- When `tududi_session_secret` is not set (the default), the addon now
  auto-generates a cryptographically strong 64-byte hex secret on first
  start and persists it to `/data/.session_secret` (chmod 600).
- Sessions now survive addon restarts without any user configuration.
- The config field is now optional (`str?`) and hidden from the default
  options UI. Power users can still set it manually as an override.
- Previously, leaving the secret empty meant sessions were lost on every
  restart and a warning was logged asking the user to configure it.

**IMPROVED:** Simplified Dockerfile sed fixes
- Removed index.html sed rewrites (upstream publicPath and dynamic base tag handle this)
- Removed login-gfx.png sed rewrites (upstream already uses getAssetPath())
- Only logo path sed fixes remain (upstream bug: Navbar.tsx and Login.tsx
  hardcode absolute paths instead of using getAssetPath())

**IMPROVED:** Port option hidden from UI
- The port must match ingress_port (3002). Changing it breaks ingress access.
- Hidden from default options (int?) to prevent accidental misconfiguration.
- run.sh logs a warning if port is overridden to a non-3002 value.
