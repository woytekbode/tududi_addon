All notable changes to this add-on will be documented in this file.

## 1.2.4
**BUMPED:** bumped to tududi v1.2.4 (stable release)

Large jump from the previous pin (v1.1.0-dev.14). Upstream progressed through
v1.1.0 -> v1.1.1 -> v1.2.0 -> v1.2.1 -> v1.2.3 -> v1.2.4. Addon-relevant
highlights below; full upstream notes: https://github.com/chrisvel/tududi/releases

**Trust proxy / rate limiting (addon-relevant):**
- `TUDUDI_TRUST_PROXY=true` is now converted to a single trusted proxy hop
  (instead of boolean `true`) with a startup warning, fixing the
  `ERR_ERL_PERMISSIVE_TRUST_PROXY` error flood and 500s on auth routes behind
  a reverse proxy (#1273, fixes #1258). The addon still exports
  `TUDUDI_TRUST_PROXY=true`, which is correct for HA Ingress (a single proxy
  hop) - expect a new informational warning line at startup.

**Docker / data storage (addon-relevant):**
- Canonical data paths moved from `/app/backend/db` to `/app/db`, with an
  automatic copy of pre-v1.2.0 data on first start (#1250, #1269). The addon
  is unaffected: `run.sh` overrides `DB_FILE=/data/production.sqlite3` and
  `TUDUDI_UPLOAD_PATH=/data/uploads`, so data stays under `/data`.
- First-install robustness: `SQLITE_BUSY` race fixed via an `afterConnect`
  `busy_timeout` hook (#1271); migration guards for goals/people on clean
  installs (#1268); fail-fast on migration errors instead of a restart loop
  (#1269); `dotenv` made optional in startup scripts.

**Features / fixes:**
- CalDAV: fixes for viewing externally-synced tasks and aligning sync
  direction values with the backend model (#1274, #1275).
- Interactive project status icon on the main projects page (#1272).
- Calendar shows task titles instead of recurrence-frequency labels (#1253).
- Prevent subtask deletion on kanban / eisenhower / undo paths (#1252).
- Comprehensive MCP integration documentation (#1086).

**Addon files changed:**
- `Dockerfile`: clone branch `v1.1.0-dev.14` -> `v1.2.4`.
- `config.yaml`: version `1.1.0-dev.14.2` -> `1.2.4`, updated description.

## 1.1.0-dev.14.2
**ADDED:** Two HA config toggles for upstream Tududi feature flags

- `tududi_trust_proxy` (default `true`) - now exposed as a user option.
  Controls `TUDUDI_TRUST_PROXY`. Previously hardcoded to `true` in `.14.1`.
  Keep on for HA Ingress (the reverse proxy in front of every HA addon);
  disable only in advanced non-ingress setups where the upstream proxy is
  not trusted. `run.sh` logs a warning when disabled.
- `ff_enable_mcp` (default `false`) - new option, controls `FF_ENABLE_MCP`.
  When enabled, tududi exposes `/api/mcp/*` endpoints protected by a Bearer
  API token. Users must generate an API token in Profile -> API Keys to use
  the server. Matches upstream default.

Friendly names and descriptions for both options added in
`translations/en.yaml` so they render nicely in the HA config UI.

Addon-side change only - still pinned to upstream tududi v1.1.0-dev.14.

## 1.1.0-dev.14.1
**FIXED:** 401-after-login regression behind HA ingress
- Export `TUDUDI_TRUST_PROXY=true` so Tududi calls
  `app.set('trust proxy', true)`. Without this, Express ignores the
  `X-Forwarded-*` headers from HA ingress; combined with the upstream
  change in v1.0.0+ (#1008) that ties `cookie.secure` to `NODE_ENV`,
  the secure session cookie set on `/api/login` was not honored on the
  round-trip and every subsequent `/api/*` returned 401, bouncing the
  frontend to a 404 route.
- Addon-side patch only - still pinned to upstream tududi v1.1.0-dev.14.
- Upstream context: chrisvel/tududi#1023.

## 0.89.0
**BUMPED:** bumped to tududi v0.89.0 (stable release)

**IMPROVED:** Session secret auto-generation
- When `tududi_session_secret` is not set (the default), the addon now
  auto-generates a cryptographically strong 64-byte hex secret on first
  start and persists it to `/data/.session_secret` (chmod 600).
- Sessions now survive addon restarts without any user configuration.
- The config field is now optional (`str?`) and hidden from the default
  options UI. Power users can still set it manually as an override.
- Previously, leaving the secret empty meant sessions were lost on every
  restart and a warning was logged asking the user to configure it.

**IMPROVED:** Simplified Dockerfile sed fixes
- Removed index.html sed rewrites (upstream publicPath and dynamic base tag handle this)
- Removed login-gfx.png sed rewrites (upstream already uses getAssetPath())
- Only logo path sed fixes remain (upstream bug: Navbar.tsx and Login.tsx
  hardcode absolute paths instead of using getAssetPath())

**IMPROVED:** Port option hidden from UI
- The port must match ingress_port (3002). Changing it breaks ingress access.
- Hidden from default options (int?) to prevent accidental misconfiguration.
- run.sh logs a warning if port is overridden to a non-3002 value.

**TUDUDI v0.89.0 CHANGELOG:**
- Fix remaining multi-weekday recurrence bugs by @chrisvel in #838
